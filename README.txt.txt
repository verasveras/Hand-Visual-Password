// This project was originally submitted as coursework for evaluation at Columbia University. // 

The program takes in 3 images (their location is hardcoded). Each image is of a hand against a dark background. 
Hands may be on any location on the image and can hold up anywhere from 0 to 5 fingers. The program is able to 
differentiate between the numbers of fingers and hands in different locations. The input images are compared to
a pre-defined sequence of hand positions and finger displays, a password. The program determines if the input
matches the password.
